# Bank_Telemarketing
Bank telemarketing and machine learning.

An important source of income at banks is the term deposit, i.e., deposits by customers
at a fixed rate for a fixed time. This capital can be used to disburse loans at a higher interest rate.
The bank, hence, uses marketing techniques to target customers to save via term deposits. For
example: email, advertisement, telephonic and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing (i.e.,
phone calls) remains an effective way to acquire term deposit customers, especially if enabled
with machine learning. Banks can use data and machine learning informed alert models to
identify customers who are more likely to save via a term deposit, and to inform a telephonic
marketing campaign accordingly.
The dataset, in this assignment, is related to the direct telemarketing campaigns (phone
calls) of a European banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit (Term Deposit = 1). Tapping into the repertoire of your Machine Learning modelling, evaluation and
deployment knowledge, provide recommendations to the bankâ€™s Retail Marketing department
to achieve its goal.
